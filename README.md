This is a little bot for adding things to the [Cover Art Archive](http://coverartarchive.org) from arbitrary URLs. You'll need a username and password from [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org) to use it, since that's how edits on the cover art archive happen.

Right now it will only upload front-cover images, and only if there isn't any cover art already. This may or may not ever get fixed.

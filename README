This is a little bot for adding things to the Cover Art Archive (http://coverartarchive.org) from local files or arbitrary URLs. You'll need a username and password from MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org) to use it, since that's how edits on the cover art archive happen.

Depends on LWP::Simple, Getopt::Long and WWW::Mechanize.

Run it using: perl bot.pl [options] datafile username

"username" is your username on musicbrainz.org.

"datafile" should be a tab-separated data file with the following fields:
MBID
Filename or URL
Type(s), separated by a comma (e.g. "Front", "Back,Spine"). Defaults to "Front" if left blank. Use "None" if you really don't want to set a type.
Comment (optional)
Relationship ID (l_release_url.id) if you want to delete a relationship (optional)

Options:
-n --note: edit note to use
-m --max: how many (max) pieces to upload in a given run (default: 100)
-t --tmpdir: a temporary directory (default: "/tmp/")
-p --password: password (if not provided, will prompt)
-r --remove-note: edit note to use when removing a relationship
-v --verbose: be chatty (default: not very talkative)
   --use-front: use the front instead of the index to determine cover art presence

Right now it will only upload images if there isn't any cover art already. This may or may not ever get fixed.
